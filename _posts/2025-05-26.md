Artificial Intelligence (AI) presents both benefits and threats to programmers. On the positive side, AI tools like code assistants, debuggers, and auto-completion systems increase productivity, reduce errors, and speed up development. They help programmers learn faster, automate repetitive tasks, and focus on complex problem-solving rather than boilerplate code.

However, AI also poses threats. As AI systems become more capable, they may automate entire programming tasks, potentially reducing demand for certain developer roles. Low-code and no-code platforms, powered by AI, allow non-programmers to build applications, which may marginalise traditional coding skills.

Security and ethical concerns are also significant. AI can introduce vulnerabilities if used without oversight, and biased training data can lead to flawed systems. Furthermore, overreliance on AI may hinder skill development and critical thinking in novice programmers.

In conclusion, AI is both a tool and a challenge. It empowers programmers by enhancing productivity and learning but also pressures them to evolve continuously to stay relevant. Those who adapt—by improving their understanding of AI, learning to integrate it effectively, and focusing on higher-level design and problem-solving—are likely to benefit. Those who resist change may find their roles diminished. Ultimately, the impact depends on how programmers use AI.
